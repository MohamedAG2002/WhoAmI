There once was a boy who was 
loved dearly by his parents 
and two sisters. Though he did not 
show it, he loved them too.
*

He liked to play in the streets 
with his friends. Laughing and 
smiling all day. Dreaming 
of the future and what it might bring.
*

"I want to be a wrestler," the boy 
shouted. "I want to be a cop," 
another boy replied. They made up names 
and became the heroes of their own stories.
*

The world was so simple. It was always 
bright. The sun was always shining. He 
felt that he could fly. He could fly 
and nothing would stop him. 
* 

He would come back home with a smile on 
his face. Filled with dirt and stinking with
sweat but joyous and filled with more energy.
*

He would tell his father about his day. 
His father would listen and laugh.
He and his sisters would spend the rest 
of the day playing and joking around.
*

He was a happy boy. So happy. He never 
realized it... soon he will.
*

"We're low on money currently," his father said. 
"But don't worry, kid. Everything will be fine."
*

He had to move away. Far away. Away 
from his friends. Away from his house. 
He had to abandon everything. All of them did.
* 

He did not want to leave. He wanted to stay.
He wanted his friends. He wanted his house.
He wanted his life... but it never was his. 
Nothing was.
*

He felt the pain. Felt it deep within him. 
He had to endure. Silently, he had to take it.
He wanted to weep. To cry. Like the kid he was. 
But he kept it inside. He should not weep. Not now.
*

He saw the smiles fade away. The laughs soon 
became sobs. The tears flowed like never before. 
He forgot how to smile. He forgot how to laugh.
*

Hunger, cold, fear, anger. He felt them all. 
Emotions he never knew. Emotions he tried to stop. 
But he was weak. He was so weak...
*

Jump. Jump, boy. Leave. Make it out. 
Don't stay. Why can't you jump? Why 
are you so useless? Can't you see the light? 
It's there. Jump. Do it!
*

Darkness... how awful it is. He did not see. 
He did not feel. He only heard. Did it matter? 
Did it matter if he saw? 
*

He heard his mother's cries. He heard 
his sisters' weeps. He did not endure to see.
He would weep if he did. He should not weep.
* 

He saw his sisters as they willowed in darkness. 
He saw his father work so hard all day. 
He saw his mother as she almost...
* 

What was it? What made him stay? He could 
leave. At any time, he could exit. Why? 
Was it that fire? That fire inside him? 
The fire he always felt and heard but never saw?
*

Was it God? No. It never was him. 
God never helped him. Why should he help him now?
*

Was it love? Cannot be. The people he adored 
were incapable of love now due to the darkness.
*

Confidence perhaps? Never. He never had it. 
Why should he have it now? 
* 

It was something else. Something else he never knew. 
Something that called him by name. A light. A fiery red 
light. He can hear it. He can feel it. He can almost see it.
*

The fire was his chance. His savior. It never let him be.
It always stood by him. It always kept him safe. 
Through the darkness, the fire lit his way.
*

It's brighter now. Not as bright as before but he 
did not mind. Now, he can see. Now, he can feel. 
He saw the smiles that still lingered. He heard the 
laughs that still echoed.
*

The bright sun has diminished. But it's okay. 
It is still beautiful. He still loves it. He still feels it...
*

He fell again. But now he knows. He knows the fire. 
He knows the way to it. He knows the darkness. He 
knows when the darkness will arrive and he knows 
how to deal with it. 
*

He might never see his old friends again.
He might never see his old house again. 
He might never smile or laugh like before.
But at least now he knows the fire.
* 

The fire will always stay with him. He will always 
keep it by. He will always go to it. The boy never 
knew who he was. With the fire, he now knows. He 
now understands...
*
