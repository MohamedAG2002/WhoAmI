# WhoAmI
You play the game as a boy who looks through his past. The boy has no face and no body. He is only a square that has no features. Similar to other shapes. He is not special. You'll control the boy's movement and direction. However, there is not much to change regarding the course you're going to take. The road has already been drawn and set up for you. You are only supposed to sit there and live. Live the events through the boy's eyes. Hear what he heard. See what he saw. Feel what he felt. There's not much you can do. Try but you'll fail. The boy has already cried. He has already died inside. Just move with the flow. You cannot change the past. Not his or yours. Just go along. The world has already made the road for you. Take it and be happy. Do as the boy did. Know him. Understand him. Don't judge him.

# Controls 
To control the boy, you only need to use [A] and [D] or the [LEFT] and [RIGHT] arrow keys to move horizontally. The boy can also jump with the [SPACE] bar. Make sure you time your jumps correctly as there is no way to go back up there. Once you fall you never get up. Remember that. Even though it does not change anything, you can pause the past to observe. Pause the past by pressing [P]. There is not much use to pause the past. It already happened. Don't try to postpone what is bound to happen.

# Build 
Listen, the code of this game is probably the worst code you'll ever see. It is not the proudest thing I've written. There is a lot of areas in the codebase where you'll say, "Oh holy fuck what in the holy baby Jesus is this? Why the fuck is it... holy crap!"
I don't blame you. I know it's bad and I know it's not the best. But listen, I wanted to make this game quickly without thinking much about the code. I made the game and that's the most important part. However, if you are still interested in building the game, you can follow the instructions below. Fucking moron.

```
git clone https://github.com/MohamedAG2002/WhoAmI.git
